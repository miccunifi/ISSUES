## Overview

### Abstract

Multimodal image-text memes are prevalent on the internet, serving as a unique form of communication that combines visual and textual elements to convey humor, ideas, or emotions. However, some memes take a malicious turn, promoting hateful content and perpetuating discrimination. Detecting hateful memes within this multimodal context is a challenging task that requires understanding the intertwined meaning of text and images. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a novel approach named ISSUES for multimodal hateful meme classification. ISSUES leverages a pre-trained CLIP vision-language model and the textual inversion technique to effectively capture the multimodal semantic content of the memes. The experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the Hateful Memes Challenge and HarMeme datasets.

Overview of the proposed approach. We disentangle CLIP common embedding space via linear projections. We employ textual inversion to make the textual representation multimodal. We fuse the textual and visual features with a [Combiner](https://github.com/ABaldrati/CLIP4Cir) architecture. $E_{L}$ represents the CLIP embedding lookup layer. $\phi$ indicates the [SEARLE](https://github.com/miccunifi/SEARLE) textual inversion network.

<summary><h2>Usage</h2></summary>

### Pre-trained models

We provide the pre-trained models in the [release](https://github.com/miccunifi/ISSUES/releases/tag/latest). Ensure that the weights match the following structure:

<pre>
project_base_path
└─── resources
  └─── datasets
      ...
  └─── <b>pretrained_models
      | hmc_text-inv-comb_best.ckpt
      | harmeme_text-inv-comb_best.ckpt
      
  └─── pretrained_weights
      | hmc
      | harmeme
      | phi
    </b>
  
└─── src
  | combiner.py
  | datasets.py
  | engine.py

### Training and Testing
We provide scripts for training and testing our approach on the HMC and HarMeme datasets.

<pre>
project_base_path
└─── resources
  ...
  
└─── src
  ...

<b>
run_harmeme_text-inv-comb.sh
run_hmc_text-inv-comb.sh
</b>

...
</pre>

To use a script, navigate to the root folder and use the following commands:

```shell
chmod +x <filename>.sh
./<filename>.sh
```
where:
- ```<filename> = run_harmeme_text-inv-comb``` is related to the HarMeme dataset
- ```<filename> = run_hmc_text-inv-comb``` is related to the HMC dataset

For <b>training</b> the model from scratch and then evaluating its performance, disable the ```--reproduce``` flag of the script.

For <b>testing</b> the pre-trained models and reproducing our results, enable the ```--reproduce``` flag of the script.
